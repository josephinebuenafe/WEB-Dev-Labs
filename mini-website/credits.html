        <p>
          The <strong>Philippine Festivals Guide</strong> is made possible through the 
          combined efforts of individuals and resources dedicated to promoting Filipino 
          culture. This project gathers information from a variety of sources, including 
          cultural studies, tourism references, and local experiences of Filipinos who 
          actively participate in these celebrations. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We acknowledge the Department of Tourism and local government websites for 
          providing festival schedules and official details. Academic articles and cultural 
          blogs have also been valuable in shaping accurate and informative descriptions. 
          Additionally, photo inspirations were drawn from public domain and licensed 
          festival archives to showcase the lively atmosphere of these events. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, this project would not have been possible without the passion and 
          creativity of the Filipino community itself. Each festival included here reflects 
          centuries of heritage and artistry. By documenting these events, we aim to keep 
          traditions alive and inspire future generations to embrace and celebrate their 
          cultural identity.
        </p>
